# RecombGenesSex

This repository contains the data and code associated with the paper titled "Recombination enables higher numbers of recessive genes, contributing to the emergence of sexual mating in complex organisms."

## Abstract
The paper explores the drift-barrier hypothesis and the role of recombination in maintaining gene pool stability. It investigates how random genetic drift constrains phenotype refinement under natural selection and highlights the influence of factors like effective population size, mutation rate, and recessive gene count on genomic architecture.

## Reproducing the Findings
You can reproduce the findings presented in the paper using the provided code. The simulations conducted using an adaptive dynamics model with constant overall birth rate (equivalent to Wright-Fisher model) reveal transitions in mutation burden and prevalence, linked to the extinction of wild-type haplotypes. The study confirms the drift-barrier hypothesis and demonstrates the essential role of recombination in preventing population collapse and stabilizing the gene pool in complex organisms.
